# Code that was used in the PhD thesis *Contributions to the Theory of Goodness-of-Fit Testing and Change Point Detection*

## Example 1.3
The example is about comparing p-values calculated by parametric bootstrapping, conditional distributions with simulations and conditional distributions analytically.
This Variables x1 and x2 define the given data. These should be changed to calculate p-values for different data sets. In the end, all three p-values are printed out. In the sequence of: parametric bootstrapping, Monte Carlo conditional and analytical conditional.

## Example 1.5
Functions simcount, alg1, randombars and ct are part of the algorithm that draws simulations from the conditional geometric distribution. This is from the paper *Conditional Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Discrete Distributions*. The simulations are used in this example to plot the conditional test statistic's distribution. For comparison, we also plotted the distribution, calculated via parametric bootstrapping. Both of these distributions are plotted on the same graph to visualize their difference.
Variables n, d1 and d2 fix the data which is used to calculate the distributions. Green lines are then added to the graphs to visualize the observed values (test statistic values of d1 and d2).
